### What is GraphQL and Why Use It?

Technically GraphQL is only a specification for the behaviour of a GraphQL server. In practice it is a powerful query language used for APIs and a runtime to fulfill those queries. The current industry standard for developing web APIs is REST which needs a structured contract between the client and backend access points. Compared to REST, GraphQL consolidates all access to data into one point and the client can specify exactly what it needs for each request. This means developers using GraphQL can quickly make changes to data requirements for the front-end in a a more concise manner as well. Front-end developers can now make changes to the UI without the need for the back-end to change any data provided through conventional RESTful access points. This is analagous to shopping at a variety of small mom and pop shops and a superstore such as Walmart. Instead of driving to every small shop for a certain item you can go to Walmart and buy everything you need in one or multiple shops. REST is similar to those mom and pop shops where you can only access x products at y store and the superstore is analogous to GraphQL in that every product is consodated into a single store.
